# SwoLeios

This is a simple repository to select a short exercise to do for roughly 5 minutes every hour

List of things to do:
* Implement "heaps of heaps" to select exercise
* Allow user to specify time over which SwoLeios will work (weeks, days, hours, etc)
* Allow user to specify difficulty by inputting desired number of repititions

Finicky things to think about:
* Determining whether set is in reps or duration is weird for `select_reps()`
* Can we just use `time` directly?
